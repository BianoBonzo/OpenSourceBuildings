# OpenSourceBuildings

# About the Project 
This open source project would be either a mobile app or website that informs its users what buildings around their location are currently open, as well as their business hours. Let's say there are a couple of restaurants or stores near where you live. It can be annoying when you go to a restaurant thinking that its open, but then you find out the door won't budge when you get there. This app can utilize a database to check all buildings/establishments within a certain mile raidus to tell the user which buildings are 
open on which days. Instead of looking up a building's name manually on Google, you can just open up the app and tell you nearby establishments that are available to you. Users can use the app to plan where to go on certain days of the week and prevent unnecessary commute time. This app can be highly valuable for campus students or residents of busy cities.  

# Business Model 
Our project could be used by various campuses and businesses, attracting a lot of developers to contribute back to the original project. In order to make money as a company, the project can be sold as software-as-a-service (SaaS), where we provide all the setup, hosting, data intake, etc. for a fee. Since it is open source, of course the end user would be welcome to do this on their own. However, due to the license, any modifications they make must be stated and shared.

# License 
We chose the GNU General Public License v3.0 for this project because it would need to be updated very often. This license is the best for sharing improvements and updates with all users. Buildings are very often closing and reopening and this would be very important information to make our application work as intended. Especially with the current condition of the world, these changes would need to be made very often to keep up with businesses closing for a day, week, or forever. This will be important to always allow the user to recieve the correct information on which buildings are available to access.
